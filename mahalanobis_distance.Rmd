# Introduction

This notebook is a snippet about Mahalanobis Distance to be used to supplement the material in other notebooks in this directory.

I populated this notebook by following the material [here](https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/understanding-mahalanobis-distance-and-its-use-cases/). In an effort to better understand the material, I will be implementing a formula which can make this calculation from scratch. In reality, there are built-in functions which achieves this effect, which would be used in production code.

# What is it?

Mahalanobis distance (MD) measures the relative distance between two variables with respect to the centroid.

# Equation

Observataions:
$$x = (x_1,x_2,x_3,...x_N)^T$$

Means:
$$\mu=(\mu_1,\mu_2,\mu_3,...\mu_N)^T$$

Covariance Matrix $$S$$

Mahalanobis Distance Formula
$$MD(x)=\sqrt{(x-\mu)^TS^{-1}(x-\mu)}$$

# As an R Function

```{r}
m1 <- matrix(sample(0:9, 12, replace = T), ncol=4)
m2 <- matrix(sample(0:9, 12, replace = T), ncol=3)

cov(m1)
cor(m1)

mahalanobis_distance <- function(x, means, covariance){
  
}

det(m1)

library(matlib)

mahalanobis_distance(c(2, 4, 3), c())

```
