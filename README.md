# Purpose / Scope of this Content

The files contained in this directory are created to supplement my understanding of various statistical concepts. I generally learn by doing, so while I review material, it is useful to me to code out the examples myself. Each file should contain a reference to the main material which I am referencing, and is hopefully sequestered to just one topic.

The hope, is that by doing this, it will make it easier for me to retrieve previous lessons and learned content more easily. By making this process easier, my hope is that it will remove some of the burden to be a continual learner, and eventual develop into a better statistician.
